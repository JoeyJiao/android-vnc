immediate:
----------

make SDLvncviewer more versatile
	- Send modifiers key-up on leave focus,
	- test for missing keys (especially "[]{}" with ./examples/mac),
	- map Apple/Linux/Windows keys onto each other,
	- keyboard repeat,
	- introduce scrollbars,
	- handle selection
style fixes: use Linux' coding guidelines & ANSIfy tightvnc-filetransfer:
	discuss on list
LibVNCClient cleanup: prefix with "rfbClient", and make sure it does
	not deliberately die() or exit() anywhere!
java vncviewer doesn't do colour cursors?
MinGW32 doesn't do fcntl on sockets; use setsockopt instead...
make corre work again (libvncclient or libvncserver?)
teach SDLvncviewer about CopyRect...
implement "-record" in libvncclient

later:
------

selectbox: scroll bars
authentification schemes (secure vnc)
	IO function ptr exists; now explain how to tunnel and implement a
	client address restriction scheme.
using Hermes library for fast colour translations.
